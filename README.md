# Weather_Dashboard

## Description
Created a weather dashboard that retrieves weather data for cities. It shows the searched city's current weather forecast of temp, wind, humidity, and the current cities five day forecast. This uses the users localStorage to store and save past searched cities. I made this using VsCode. Jquery, bootstrap, Day.js, and the OpenWeather API.
